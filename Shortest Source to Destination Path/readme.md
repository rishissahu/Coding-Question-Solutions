Given a 2D binary matrix A(0-based index) of dimensions NxM. Find the minimum number of steps required to reach from (0,0) to (X, Y).
Note: You can only move left, right, up and down, and only through cells that contain 1.

Example 1:

Input:
N=3, M=4
A=[[1,0,0,0], 
   [1,1,0,1],
   [0,1,1,1]]
X=2, Y=3 
Output:
5
Explanation:
The shortest path is as follows:
(0,0)->(1,0)->(1,1)->(2,1)->(2,2)->(2,3).
Example 2:

Input:
N=3, M=4
A=[[1,1,1,1],
   [0,0,0,1],
   [0,0,0,1]]
X=0, Y=3
Output:
3
Explanation:
The shortest path is as follows:
(0,0)->(0,1)->(0,2)->(0,3).
Your Task:
You don't need to read input or print anything. Your task is to complete the function shortestDistance() which takes the integer N, M, X, Y, and the 2D binary matrix A as input parameters and returns the minimum number of steps required to go from (0,0) to (X, Y).If it is impossible to go from (0,0) to (X, Y),then function returns -1. If value of the cell (0,0) is 0 (i.e  A[0][0]=0) then return -1.
