Given a Binary Search Tree (with all values unique) and two node values n1 and n2 (n1!=n2). Find the Lowest Common Ancestors of the two nodes in the BST.

Example 1:

Input:
              5
            /   \
          4      6
         /        \
        3          7
                    \
                     8
n1 = 7, n2 = 8
Output: 7
Example 2:

Input:
     2
   /   \
  1     3
n1 = 1, n2 = 3
Output: 2
