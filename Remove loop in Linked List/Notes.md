The given code is an implementation of a function `removeLoop` that is used to remove a loop in a linked list. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The function takes a head node of a linked list as input.
2. It initializes two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the linked list.
3. The code then enters a loop where it moves the `fast` pointer two steps ahead and the `slow` pointer one step ahead.
4. If at any point the `fast` pointer encounters a null value (reaching the end of the list), it means that there is no loop in the linked list, so the function returns.
5. If the `slow` and `fast` pointers meet (i.e., there is a loop in the list), the loop is detected, and the loop-breaking process begins.
6. After breaking the loop, the `slow` pointer is reset to the head of the list.
7. Both the `slow` and `fast` pointers now move one step at a time until they meet again. The point where they meet is the node just before the start of the loop.
8. Finally, the `next` pointer of the node where the `fast` pointer is currently pointing is set to `null`, breaking the loop.

The time complexity of this code is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The first loop, used to detect the loop, will run at most n iterations because the `fast` pointer moves two steps at a time. The second loop, used to find the node just before the loop, will run at most n iterations because both pointers move one step at a time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear in the number of nodes in the linked list.

The space complexity of this code is O(1) because it uses a constant amount of extra space to store the `slow` and `fast` pointers.
